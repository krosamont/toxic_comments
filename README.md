### Introduction


In this repository you will find my different models for the Kaggle competition: Toxic comments.
You can directly execute **validationModel_aucScore.R** to see the results.

If you want to execute the **trainModel_keras.r**, first you have to download GloVe [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)
and put them in data/glove.6B/.

You will find in the folder **data**:
  - different dataset in the rds format to quickly execute the code.
You will find in the folder **model**:
  - different models neural networks models that where made with Keras.

Models from the folder **model** where built with **You should first train the model with **trainModel_keras.r**


If you have any issues to make it work correctly, you can always [contact me](mailto:kevin@rdata.lu).
